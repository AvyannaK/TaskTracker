# TaskTracker

The task tracker sets up a form submission listener and defines actions to be completed when the form is submitted. Each action is attached to an event listener that will do what the task is asking. For example When the edit button is clicked the event listener checks if the event is edit and then allows for the text input to be editable vs read-only. This task tracker is also on a server with a listening port specifed at 8000.
